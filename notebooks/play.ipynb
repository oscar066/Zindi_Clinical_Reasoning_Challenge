He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them.

It seems that his staff simply never answers the phone.  It usually takes 2 hours of repeated calling to get an answer.  Who has time for that or wants to deal with it?  I have run into this problem with many other doctors and I just don't get it.  You have office workers, you have patients with medical needs, why isn't anyone answering the phone?  It's incomprehensible and not work the aggravation.  It's with regret that I feel that I have to give Dr. Goldberg 2 stars.  \n",

I think I was one of his 1st patients when he started at MHMG. He's been great over the years and is really all about the big picture. It is because of him, not my now former gyn Dr. Markoff, that I found out I have fibroids. He explores all options with you and is very patient and understanding. He doesn't judge and asks all the right questions. Very thorough and wants to be kept in the loop on every aspect of your medical health and your life.  \n",

He will be missed very much.  \\n\\nI think finding a new doctor in NYC that you actually like might almost be as awful as trying to find a date!  \n",
       "4  I don't know what Dr. Goldberg was like before  moving to Arizona, but let me tell you, STAY AWAY from this doctor and this office. I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them. I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money.  "

The group of stakeholders shall include a broad range of stakeholders involved in the development of dairy methane reduction projects, including, but not limited to, project developers, dairy and livestock industry representatives, state and local permitting agencies, energy agency representatives, compost producers with experience composting dairy manure, environmental and conservation stakeholders, public health experts, and others with demonstrated expertise relevant to the success of dairy methane emissions reduction efforts.\\n(B) Provide a forum for public engagement by holding at least three public meetings in geographically diverse locations throughout the state where dairy operations and livestock operations are present.\\n(C) In consultation with the department, do both of the following:\\n(i) Conduct or consider livestock and dairy operation research on dairy methane emissions reduction projects, including, but not limited to, scrape manure management systems, solids separation systems, and enteric fermentation.\\n(ii) Consider developing and adopting methane emissions reduction protocols.\\n(3) The state board shall make available to the public by posting on its Internet Web site a report on the progress made in implementing paragraph (2). Pursuant to Section 9795 of the Government Code, the state board shall notify the Legislature of the report.\\n(4) Notwithstanding the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code), the regulations adopted pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be implemented on or after January 1, 2024, if the state board, in consultation with the department, determines all of the following:\\n(A) The regulations are technologically feasible.\\n(B) The regulations are economically feasible considering milk and live cattle prices and the commitment of state, federal, and private funding, among other things, and that markets exist for the products generated by dairy manure management and livestock manure management methane emissions reduction projects, including composting, biomethane, and other products. The analysis shall include consideration of both of the following:\\n(i) Electrical interconnection of onsite electrical generation facilities using biomethane.\\n(ii) Access to common carrier pipelines available for the injection of digester biomethane.\\n(C) The regulations are cost effective.\\n(D) The regulations include provisions to minimize and mitigate potential leakage to other states or countries, as appropriate.\\n(E) The regulations include an evaluation of the achievements made by incentive-based programs.\\n(c) No later than July 1, 2020, the state board, in consultation with the department, shall analyze the progress the dairy and livestock sector has made in achieving the goals identified in the strategy and specified in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b). The analysis shall determine if sufficient progress has been made to overcome technical and market barriers, as identified in the strategy. If the analysis determines that progress has not been made in meeting the targets due to insufficient funding or technical or market barriers, the state board, in consultation with the department and upon consultation with stakeholders, may reduce the goal in the strategy for the dairy and livestock sectors, as identified pursuant to paragraph (1).\\n(d) (1) (A) No later than January 1, 2018, the state board, in consultation with the commission and the energy commission, shall establish energy infrastructure development and procurement policies needed to encourage dairy biomethane projects to meet the goal identified pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b).\\n(B) The state board shall develop a pilot financial mechanism to reduce the economic uncertainty associated with the value of environmental credits, including credits pursuant to the Low-Carbon Fuel Standard regulations (Subarticle 7 (commencing with Section 95480) of Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations) from dairy-related projects producing low-carbon transportation fuels.

Existing law also requires any physician, dentist, podiatrist, or other health care practitioner diagnosing or providing treatment for cancer patients to report each cancer case to the department or the authorized representative of the department, except for those cases directly referred to a treatment facility or those previously admitted to a treatment facility for diagnosis or treatment of that instance of cancer.\\nThis bill, on or after January 1, 2019, would, among other things, require a pathologist diagnosing cancer to report cancer diagnoses to the department by electronic means, including, but not limited to, either directly from an electronic medical record or using a designated Internet Web portal provided by the department. If a pathologist fails to report electronically and with an approved format, the bill would authorize the department’s authorized representative to access the information from the pathologist in an appropriate alternative format. In these cases, the bill would require the pathologist to reimburse the department or the authorized representative for its cost to access and report the information. The bill would require the department to prescribe the data required to be included in the reports and to work collaboratively with stakeholders to designate a standardized electronic format for submission of the reports.</td>\n",

2699 of the Labor Code is amended to read:\\n2699.\\n(a) Notwithstanding any other\\nprovision of\\nlaw, any provision of this code that provides for a civil penalty to be assessed and collected by the Labor and Workforce Development Agency or any of its departments, divisions, commissions, boards, agencies, or employees, for a violation of this code, may, as an alternative, be recovered through a civil action brought by an aggrieved employee on behalf of himself or herself and other current or former employees pursuant to the procedures specified in Section 2699.3.\\n(b) For purposes of this part, “person” has the same meaning as defined in Section 18.\\n(c) For purposes of this part, “aggrieved employee” means any person who was employed by the alleged violator and against whom one or more of the alleged violations was committed.\\n(d) For purposes of this part, “cure” means that the employer abates each violation alleged by any aggrieved employee, the employer is in compliance with the underlying statutes as specified in the notice required by this part, and any aggrieved employee is made whole. A violation of paragraph (6) or (8) of subdivision (a) of Section 226 shall only be considered cured upon a showing that the employer has provided a fully compliant, itemized wage statement to each aggrieved employee for each pay period for the three-year period prior to the date of the written notice sent pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 2699.3.\\n(e) (1) For purposes of this part, whenever the Labor and Workforce Development Agency, or any of its departments, divisions, commissions, boards, agencies, or employees, has discretion to assess a civil penalty, a court is authorized to exercise the same discretion, subject to the same limitations and conditions, to assess a civil penalty.\\n(2) In any action by an aggrieved employee seeking recovery of a civil penalty available under subdivision (a) or (f), a court may award a lesser amount than the maximum civil penalty amount specified by this part if, based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case, to do otherwise would result in an award that is unjust, arbitrary and oppressive, or confiscatory. In no event shall the total amount of that penalty equal more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each aggrieved employee.\\n(f) For all provisions of this code except those for which a civil penalty is specifically provided, there is established a civil penalty for a violation of these provisions, as follows:\\n(1) If, at the time of the alleged violation, the person does not employ one or more employees, the civil penalty is five hundred dollars ($500).\\n(2) If, at the time of the alleged violation, the person employs one or more employees, the civil penalty is one hundred dollars ($100) for each aggrieved employee per pay period for the initial violation and two hundred dollars ($200) for each aggrieved employee per pay period for each subsequent violation.\\n(3) If the alleged violation is a failure to act by the Labor and Workplace Development Agency, or any of its departments, divisions, commissions, boards, agencies, or employees, there shall be no civil penalty.\\n(g) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), an aggrieved employee may recover the civil penalty described in subdivision (f) in a civil action pursuant to the procedures specified in Section 2699.3 filed on behalf of himself or herself and other current or former employees against whom one or more of the alleged violations was committed. Any employee who prevails in any action shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. Nothing in this part shall operate to limit an employee’s right to pursue or recover other remedies available under state or federal law, either separately or concurrently with an action taken under this part.\\n(2) No action shall be brought under this part for any violation of a posting, notice, agency reporting, or filing requirement of this code, except where the filing or reporting requirement involves mandatory payroll or workplace injury reporting.\\n(h) No action may be brought under this section by an aggrieved employee if the agency or any of its departments, divisions, commissions, boards, agencies, or employees, on the same facts and theories, cites a person within the timeframes set forth in Section 2699.3 for a violation of the same section or sections of the Labor Code under which the aggrieved employee is attempting to recover a civil penalty on behalf of himself or herself or others or initiates a proceeding pursuant to Section 98.3.\\n(i) Except as provided in subdivision (j), civil penalties recovered by aggrieved employees shall be distributed as follows: 75 percent to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency for enforcement of labor laws and education of employers and employees about their rights and responsibilities under this code, to be continuously appropriated to supplement and not supplant the funding to the agency for those purposes; and 25 percent to the aggrieved employees.\\n(j) Civil penalties recovered under paragraph (1) of subdivision (f) shall be distributed to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency for enforcement of labor laws and education of employers and employees about their rights and responsibilities under this code, to be continuously appropriated to supplement and not supplant the funding to the agency for those purposes.\\n(k) Nothing contained in this part is intended to alter or otherwise affect the exclusive remedy provided by the workers’ compensation provisions of this code for liability against an employer for the compensation for any injury to or death of an employee arising out of and in the course of employment.\\n(l) The superior court shall review and approve any penalties sought as part of a proposed settlement agreement pursuant to this part.\\n(m) This section shall not apply to the recovery of administrative and civil penalties in connection with the workers’ compensation law as contained in Division 1 (commencing with Section 50) and Division 4 (commencing with Section 3200), including, but not limited to, Sections 129.5 and 132a.\\n(n) The agency or any of its departments, divisions, commissions, boards, or agencies may promulgate regulations to implement the provisions of this part.   \n",

declares all of the following:\\n(1) Teachers in state-funded educational child development programs are denied living wages.\\n(2) Low wages for the predominantly female staff of these programs contributes significantly to the gender pay gap in California.\\n(3) Many nonprofit, community-based child development agencies are unable to provide employer-paid health insurance to their employees and their families.\\n(4) There is a steady stream of both school district and nonprofit agencies closing their child development programs.\\n(5) The cause of these problems is an inadequate standard reimbursement rate for state-funded child development centers, due to a 34-year history of either no annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) or substandard raises. The lack of adequate COLAs has cut the buying power, wages, and benefits in these agencies by 22 percent since 1980, and has bankrupted programs.\\n(b) (1) It is the intent of the Legislature to both consistently provide these state-funded child development programs with annual cost-of-living adjustments equal to the inflation adjustments given to K–12 education programs, and to take additional steps to rebuild wages, benefits, and financial stability in these programs.\\n(2) It is the intent of the Legislature to eliminate gender pay inequity in wages for the predominantly female and college educated staff of these programs.\\n(3) It is the intent of the Legislature to ensure and enhance the ability of these programs for young children to meet the high educational standards required by state and federal law and regulations, and to retain skilled and trained teachers by increasing the standard reimbursement rate.\\nSECTION 1.\\nSEC. 2.\\nSection 8265 of the Education Code is amended to read:\\n8265.\\n(a) The Superintendent shall implement a plan that establishes reasonable standards and assigned reimbursement rates, which vary with the length of the program year and the hours of service.\\n(1) Parent fees shall be used to pay reasonable and necessary costs for providing additional services.\\n(2) When establishing standards and assigned reimbursement rates, the Superintendent shall confer with applicant agencies.\\n(3) The reimbursement system, including standards and rates, shall be submitted to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee.\\n(4) The Superintendent may establish any regulations he or she deems advisable concerning conditions of service and hours of enrollment for children in the programs.\\n(b)\\n(1)\\nThe standard reimbursement rate shall be nine thousand twenty-four dollars and seventy-five cents ($9,024.75) per unit of average daily enrollment for a 250-day year, and commencing with the 2015–16 fiscal year, shall be increased by the cost-of-living adjustment granted by the Legislature annually pursuant to Section 42238.15.\\nThe standard reimbursement rate is not intended to fund mandated costs imposed upon child development programs due to actions of law relating to minimum wage requirements, health insurance requirements, new or increased fees, new or expanded program requirements, or other cost increases due to legislative action.\\n(2) In addition to the increase in paragraph (1), the standard reimbursement rate shall be raised as needed to provide a living wage, reasonable health insurance, and retirement benefits for employees, to support the recruitment and retention of skilled and trained teachers, to support the financial stability of programs and educational quality, and to achieve gender pay equity.\\n(3) For purposes of this subdivision, “cost-of-living adjustment” means an annual increase in funding and the standard reimbursement rate to maintain buying power as the result of inflation. Notwithstanding any other law, for each fiscal year, the amount of cost-of-living adjustment provided by Section 42238.15 shall at least be equal to the amount of the inflation adjustment provided by Section 42238.1.\\n(c) The plan shall require agencies having an assigned reimbursement rate above the current year standard reimbursement rate to reduce costs on an incremental basis to achieve the standard reimbursement rate.\\n(d) The plan shall provide for adjusting reimbursement on a case-by-case basis, in order to maintain service levels for agencies currently at a rate less than the standard reimbursement rate. Assigned reimbursement rates shall be increased only on the basis of one or more of the following:\\n(1) Loss of program resources from other sources.\\n(2) Need of an agency to pay the same child care rates as those prevailing in the local community.\\n(3) Increased costs directly attributable to new or different regulations.\\n(4) (A) Documented increased costs necessary to maintain the prior year’s level of service and ensure the continuation of threatened programs.\\n(B) Child care agencies funded at the lowest rates shall be given first priority for increases.\\n(e) The plan shall provide for expansion of child development programs at no more than the standard reimbursement rate for that fiscal year.\\n(f) The Superintendent may reduce the percentage of reduction for a public agency that satisfies any of the following:\\n(1) Serves more than 400 children.\\n(2) Has in effect a collective bargaining agreement.\\n(3) Has other extenuating circumstances that apply, as determined by the Superintendent.   \n",

follows:\\n\\n\\nSECTION 1.\\nSection 103885 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:\\n103885.\\n(a) The director shall establish a statewide system for the collection of information determining the incidence of cancer, using population-based cancer registries modeled after the Cancer Surveillance Program of Orange County. As of the effective date of this section, the director shall begin phasing in the statewide cancer reporting system. By July 1, 1988, all county or regional registries shall be implemented or initiated. By July 1, 1990, the statewide cancer reporting system shall be fully operational. Within 60 days of the effective date of this section, the director shall submit an implementation and funding schedule to the Legislature.\\n(b) The department may designate any demographic parts of the state as regional cancer incidence reporting areas and may establish regional cancer registries, with the responsibility and authority to carry out the intent of this section in designated areas. Designated regional registries shall provide, on a timely basis, cancer incidence data as designated by the state department to the department. The department may establish a competitive process to receive applications for, and issue, the award of a contract, grant, or allocation of funds, including, but not limited to, a cooperative agreement, subvention agreement, or any other agreement allowed by law, to an agency, including, but not limited to, a health systems agency, single county health department, multicounty health department grouping, or nonprofit professional association to operate the statewide cancer reporting system and to enter into contracts, or issue grants or funding allocations to other agencies representing a designated cancer reporting region for the purposes of collecting and collating cancer incidence data. The award of these contracts, grants, or funding allocations shall be exempt from Part 2 (commencing with Section 10100) of Division 2 of the Public Contract Code. The department shall include appropriate terms and conditions in a contract, grant, or funding allocation to ensure the proper use of state funds, including provision for reimbursement of allowable costs, financial reporting, program performance reporting, monitoring of subgrants, subcontracts, or suballocations to an agency representing a designated cancer reporting region, retention and access requirements for records, data use and management, independent auditing, termination, and disposition of assets acquired under the contract, grant, or funding allocation.\\n(c) The director shall designate cancer as a disease required to be reported in the state or any demographic parts of the state in which cancer information is collected under this section. All cancers diagnosed or treated in the reporting area shall thereafter be reported to the representative of the department authorized to compile the cancer data, or any individual, agency, or organization designated to cooperate with that representative.\\n(d) (1) Any hospital or other facility providing therapy to cancer patients within an area designated as a cancer reporting area shall report each case of cancer to the department or the authorized representative of the department in a format prescribed by the department. If the hospital or other facility fails to report in a format prescribed by the department, the department’s authorized representative may access the information from the hospital or the facility and report it in the appropriate format. In these cases, the hospital or other health facility shall reimburse the state department or the authorized representative for its cost to access and report the information.\\n(2) Any physician and surgeon, dentist, podiatrist, or other health care practitioner diagnosing or providing treatment for cancer patients shall report each cancer case to the department or the authorized representative of the department, except for those cases directly referred to a treatment facility or those previously admitted to a treatment facility for diagnoses or treatment of that instance of cancer.\\n(3) (A) On or after January 1, 2019, a pathologist diagnosing cancer shall report cancer diagnoses to the department utilizing the College of American Pathologists cancer protocols or any other standardized format approved by the department.\\n(B) Reporting shall be by electronic means, including, but not limited to, either directly from an electronic medical record or using a designated Internet Web portal that the department shall provide for pathologists’ use. If a pathologist fails to report electronically and with an approved format, the department’s authorized representative may access the information from the pathologist in an appropriate alternative format. In these cases, the pathologist shall reimburse the department or the authorized representative for its cost to access and report the information.\\n(C) A pathologist shall not be responsible for acquiring missing or inaccessible patient demographic information not provided to him or her beyond the content of the required cancer-specific data elements.\\n(D) For purposes of reports submitted pursuant to this paragraph, the department shall prescribe the data required to be included in the report, work collaboratively with stakeholders to designate a standardized electronic format for submission, and designate an Internet Web portal for electronic submission.\\n(E) This paragraph shall not be interpreted to require a pathologist to submit the same pathology report to the department, regardless of format, more than once. If a pathology report is submitted by a pathologist electronically, pursuant to this paragraph, the same pathology report is not required to be submitted to the department by any other means.\\n(e) Any hospital or other facility that is required to reimburse the department or its authorized representative for the cost to access and report the information pursuant to subdivision (d) shall provide payment to the department or its authorized representative within 60 days of the date this payment is demanded. In the event any hospital or other facility fails to make the payment to the department or its authorized representative within 60 days of the date the payment is demanded, the department or its authorized representative may, at its discretion, assess a late fee not to exceed 1\\n1/2\\npercent per month of the outstanding balance. Further, in the event that the department or its authorized representative takes a legal action to recover its costs and any associated fees, and the department or its authorized representative receives a judgment in its favor, the hospital or other facility shall also reimburse the department or its authorized representative for any additional costs it incurred to pursue the legal action. Late fees and payments made to the department by hospitals or other facilities pursuant to this subdivision shall be considered as reimbursements of the additional costs incurred by the department.\\n(f) All physicians and surgeons, hospitals, outpatient clinics, nursing homes and all other facilities, individuals, or agencies providing diagnostic or treatment services to patients with cancer shall grant to the department or the authorized representative access to all records that would identify cases of cancer or would establish characteristics of the cancer, treatment of the cancer, or medical status of any identified cancer patient. Willful failure to grant access to those records shall be punishable by a fine of up to five hundred dollars ($500) each day access is refused. Any fines collected pursuant to this subdivision shall be deposited in the General Fund.\\n(g) (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, all information collected pursuant to this section shall be confidential. For purposes of this section, this information shall be referred to as “confidential information.”\\n(2) The department and any regional cancer registry designated by the department shall use the information to determine the sources of malignant neoplasms and evaluate measures designed to eliminate, alleviate, or ameliorate their effect.\\n(3) Persons with a valid scientific interest who are engaged in demographic, epidemiological, or other similar studies related to health who meet qualifications as determined by the department, and who agree, in writing, to maintain confidentiality, may be authorized access to confidential information.\\n(4) The department and any regional cancer registry designated by the department may enter into agreements to furnish confidential information to other states’ cancer registries, federal cancer control agencies, local health officers, or health researchers for the purposes of determining the sources of cancer and evaluating measures designed to eliminate, alleviate, or ameliorate their effect. Before confidential information is disclosed to those agencies, officers, researchers, or out-of-state registries, the requesting entity shall agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality of the information, and in the case of researchers, shall also do both of the following:\\n(A) Obtain approval of their committee for the protection of human subjects established in accordance with Part 46 (commencing with Section 46.101) of Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\\n(B) Provide documentation to the department that demonstrates to the department’s satisfaction that the entity has established the procedures and ability to maintain the confidentiality of the information.\\n(5) Notwithstanding any other law, any disclosure authorized by this section shall include only the information necessary for the stated purpose of the requested disclosure, used for the approved purpose, and not be further disclosed.\\n(6) The furnishing of confidential information to the department or its authorized representative in accordance with this section shall not expose any person, agency, or entity furnishing information to liability, and shall not be considered a waiver of any privilege or a violation of a confidential relationship.\\n(7) The department shall maintain an accurate record of all persons who are given access to confidential information. The record shall include: the name of the person authorizing access; name, title, address, and organizational affiliation of persons given access; dates of access; and the specific purpose for which information is to be used. The record of access shall be open to public inspection during normal operating hours of the department.\\n(8) Notwithstanding any other law, no part of the confidential information shall be available for subpoena, nor shall it be disclosed, discoverable, or compelled to be produced in any civil, criminal, administrative, or other proceeding, nor shall this information be deemed admissible as evidence in any civil, criminal, administrative, or other tribunal or court for any reason.\\n(9) Nothing in this subdivision shall prohibit the publication by the department of reports and statistical compilations that do not in any way identify individual cases or individual sources of information.\\n(10) Notwithstanding the restrictions in this subdivision, the individual to whom the information pertains shall have access to his or her own information in accordance with Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 1798) of Title 1.8 of the Civil Code.\\n(h) For the purpose of this section, “cancer” means either of the following:\\n(1) All malignant neoplasms, regardless of the tissue of origin, including malignant lymphoma, Hodgkins disease, and leukemia, but excluding basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.\\n(2) All primary intracranial and central nervous system (CNS) tumors occurring in the following sites, irrespective of histologic type: brain, meninges, spinal cord, caudae equina, cranial nerves and other parts of the CNS, pituitary gland, pineal gland, and craniopharyngeal duct.\\n(i) Nothing in this section shall preempt the authority of facilities or individuals providing diagnostic or treatment services to patients with cancer to maintain their own facility-based cancer registries.\\n(j) It is the intent of the Legislature that the department, in establishing a system pursuant to this section, maximize the use of available federal funds.   \n",

       "0  (1) The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 designates the State Air Resources Board as the state agency charged with monitoring and regulating sources of emissions of greenhouse gases. The state board is required to approve a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit equivalent to the statewide greenhouse gas emissions level in 1990 to be achieved by 2020. The state board is also required to complete a comprehensive strategy to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants, as defined, in the state.\\nThis bill would require the state board, no later than January 1, 2018, to approve and begin implementing that comprehensive strategy to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants to achieve a reduction in methane by 40%, hydrofluorocarbon gases by 40%, and anthropogenic black carbon by 50% below 2013 levels by 2030, as specified. The bill also would establish specified targets for reducing organic waste in landfills.\\nThis bill would require the state board, in consultation with the Department of Food and Agriculture, to adopt regulations to reduce methane emissions from livestock manure management operations and dairy manure management operations, as specified. The bill would require the state board to take certain actions prior to adopting those regulations. This bill would require the regulations to take effect on or after January 1, 2024, if the state board, in consultation with the department, makes certain determinations.\\nThis bill would require the state board, the Public Utilities Commission, and the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission to undertake various actions related to reducing short-lived climate pollutants in the state. The bill would require state agencies to consider and, as appropriate, adopt policies and incentives to significantly increase the sustainable production and use of renewable gas.\\n(2) The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, which is administered by the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, establishes an integrated waste management program that requires each county and city and county to prepare and submit to the department a countywide integrated waste management plan.\\nThe bill would require the department, in consultation with the state board, to adopt regulations that achieve the specified targets for reducing organic waste in landfills. The bill would authorize local jurisdictions to charge and collect fees to recover the local jurisdiction’s costs incurred in complying with the regulations. The bill would require, no later than July 1, 2020, the department, in consultation with the state board, to analyze the progress that the waste sector, state government, and local governments have made in achieving the specified targets for reducing organic waste in landfills. The bill would authorize the department, depending on the outcome of that analysis, to amend the regulations to include incentives or additional requirements, as specified. By adding to the duties of local governments related to organic waste in landfills, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\\n(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.   \n",

The act provides the employer with the right to cure certain violations before the employee may bring a civil action, as specified. For other violations, the act requires the employee to follow specified procedures before bringing an action.\\nThe act authorizes a court, in an action by an aggrieved employee seeking recovery of a civil penalty, as specified, to award a lesser amount than the maximum civil penalty if that penalty would be unjust, arbitrary and oppressive, or confiscatory.\\nThis bill would establish a cap on that penalty of $1,000 for each aggrieved employee.   \n",

Existing law establishes procedures by which a local government may create or authorize a local housing authority to operate within it for this purpose. Existing law authorizes those housing authorities to convey surplus lands, as specified, for the development of homes for ownership by persons and families of low or moderate income. Existing law requires every local housing authority within a county or city to file on the first day of October of each year with the Department of Housing and Community Development a complete report of its activities during the previous fiscal year, with specified recommendations.\\nThis bill would require the department, in conjunction with the California Housing Finance Agency to report, no later than January 1, 2018, on ways to increase homeownership for extremely low, very low, and low-income households. The bill would require the department and the agency to carry out and include in the report a survey of housing authorities in California, as specified.\\nExisting law declares the intent of the Legislature to preserve, upgrade, and expand the supply of housing to persons and families of low or moderate income, through the sale of specified surplus residential property owned by public agencies. Existing law establishes priorities and procedures that any state agency disposing of that surplus residential property is required to follow.\\nThis bill, on or before January 1, 2018, would require every local government agency, as defined, to adopt a mortgage program that, among other things, allocates 10% of all single-family residences that the local government agency owns and leases to become eligible for purchase by tenants presently occupying the single–family residence. The bill would require each local government agency to adopt regulations for the administration of the program that include, among other things, eligibility requirements that limit the program to use by persons with extremely low income households, very low income households, lower income households, or persons and families of low or moderate income. By imposing new duties on local government agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.   \n",
